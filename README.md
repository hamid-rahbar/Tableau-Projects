#### Questions: 
 - Identifying and assessing any changes in the number of listings, housing prices, and so on.

 - Forecasting market KPIs for the period 2018. 
 - Making recommendations based on the findings. 

## Assumptions

- The dataset contains 974,066 records of the United States Real Estate market data between 2012 and 2017 (https://www.realtor.com/research/data/).
- The dataset is from Realtor Inc.
- Some of the data fileds of 2012 is Null as they are based on previous years data.
- This project's forecasts are based on historical data. However, there are additional factors that might impact the future real estate market that are not considered in this analysis. 

## KPIs

- Median Listing Price: the listing price of the houses (because of several outliers in the listing prices, the median would be the best indicator) 
- Inventory Supplied: number of houses available in the market 
- Pending: number of houses not sold at the end of the period 
- Total Sold: number of supplied minus number of pending 
- Pending ratio: number of unsold houses in relation to total number of listings
- Days on the market (DOM): the average number of days it took for a listing to sell 
- Month-over-Month: the percentage change from the prior month 
- Year-over-Year: the percentage change from the prior year on the same date

### Median Price Analysis:

#### 2014:
    - Inclement weather through much of the country in Spring 2014 depressed housing sales for the entire year.

#### 2015:
     Price Correction: 
      - In late 2015, it became evident that the market was headed for a correction.
     Buyer Caution: 
      - Six years of gradually rising prices and a mounting backlog of unsold inventory
      - Then the self-perpetuating cycle began; more inventory continued to come onto the market while absorption slowed, feeding inventory growth even more.
      - Because 2016 was a presidential election year, buyers were even more cautious.
      - The removal of the SALT (state and local taxes) deduction in 2016, which significantly impacted New Yorkers who pay some of the highest state and local taxes in the country.
#### 2018 Forecast:
       - The median New York home price has risen 14% from the previous year to over $2,300,000.

     - The removal of the SALT (state and local taxes) deduction in 2016, which significantly impacted New Yorkers who pay some of the highest state and local taxes in the country.
#### 2018 Forecast:

### Unsold Houses Analysis:

#### 2015:
    Buyer Caution: 
      - The self-perpetuating cycle began; more inventory continued to come onto the market while absorption slowed, feeding inventory growth even more
      - Because 2016 was a presidential election year, buyers were even more cautious.
      - The removal of the SALT (state and local taxes) deduction in 2016, which significantly impacted New Yorkers who pay some of the highest state and local taxes in the country.

### 2018 Forecast:
    - Unsold inventory continues to increase by 55% in 2018.
    - This might be due to the overpriced market price of houses in the previous year, i.e. 2017.

# Key Findingd and Recommendation
- Based on the facts and analysis of its prior 5 years, in 2018, the real estate market continues growing.

- The marketing department should focus on the states with highest growth in real estate, like Nevada, Utah and Florida.
